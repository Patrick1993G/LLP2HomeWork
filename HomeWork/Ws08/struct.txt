Scenario
You have an area of size 100 by 100 to work with. Every point in this area is described by an X-Y coordinates which can only by whole positive numbers. Make sure that there are no memory leaks.

Task
Create two structures as below (using the least memory possible):

Rectangle
x-coord
y-coord
width
height
Point
x-coord
y-coord
name (char*)
Implement the following functions:

equals_point(point1, point2)
returns true if the points' x & y are the same
equals_rect(rect1, rect2)
checks if the structures are the same using memcmp(), returns true/false accordingly
contains(rect, point)
returns true if the point is in the rectangle
main()
Generate a rectangle of 50x50 at a random location (make sure it stays within your area)
Generate 1,000 unique points, named "Point1", "Point2", etc.
Check if the generated points are in the rectangle or not
Print out the percentage of points that are in the rectangle (should be around 25%)
